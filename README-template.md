## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### Issues faced

-   Getting the `#cards` in the desktop to align and position horizontally and vertically like in the design using CSS Grid layout.

### What I learned

-   Grid layout using line-based placement: Positioning items in a Grid container using grid lines and tracks.

### Useful resources

-   [Grid layout using line-based placement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_using_line-based_placement) - This tutorial from MDN DOCS documentation explains how to use line-based placement in positioning grid items.
-   [Decimal numbers not working for the span keyword used in grid layout line placement of grid items](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77399554/decimal-numbers-not-working-for-the-span-keyword-used-in-grid-layout-line-placem) - I asked this question on StackOverflow about the issue I described here [Issues faced](#issues-faced). The answer was really helpful.
